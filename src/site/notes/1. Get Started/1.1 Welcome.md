# Welcome!


## Not your typical salaried IT person.

- **They need someone to talk to**. this is for people who just don’t want to feel stranded when they have a question.
- I am their **tech handyman** - not full blown salaried IT staff person, but just there when you need someone to have your back when you have a quick question or want something fixed.
- Also: Technical + production expertise = uniquely positioned

## We make the blueprint and set you up. We are your guide.

- What we don't do:
	- Show up on call
	- available 24/7 for any emergency - we will guide you and make sure you’re well aware of the risks, if any, given any particular setup. we want you to succeed. But unfortunately it is simply not something we can guarantee in writing 24/7/365.
- What we do:
	- help oversee your overall workflow and let you know of any parts that could be done better or faster
	- email support, and screen share/phone call/video call support when feasible
	- tailored solutions
	- consultation
	- listen to your specific issues and determine the best way to resolve them without disrupting your business
	- all for a fraction of what you’d pay a salaried IT person
