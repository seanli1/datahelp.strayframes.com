# Stray Frames Does Data

We provide expert consultation for **individuals and teams who feel stranded** when it comes to managing their data and digital workflows.

Think of us as your **tech handyman**: not a salaried IT person on staff, but a trusted problem-solver, who understands both technology and video production, and can design a setup that works for the way you operate.

## Our process

We listen to your needs, create a tailored blueprint to help optimize your workflow, and then guide you through implementing it.

After setup, we offer basic maintenance for a recurring fee to keep things running smoothly (drive health and file integrity checks, NAS monitoring), and email consultation for follow-up questions or custom adjustments.

## Remote support

We work remotely, and by design, are not your on-site IT department, but we aim to make sure your setup is reliable, low-maintenance, and built to last.

> [!fail] What we don’t do
> - We can’t promise to be on-site or on-call for emergencies.
> - We cannot guarantee 24/7/365 availability. Remote support has its limits, and while we’ll do everything we can to prepare you in case of emergency, we cannot commit to immediate responses at all hours. Our goal is to make sure you have a setup that works for you while minimizing urgent issues, not to act as a full-time IT department.

> [!done] What we do
> - **Assess your overall workflow** and highlight where it can be improved for security or efficiency.
> - **Provide support via email**, as well as scheduled screen sharing and phone/video calls.
> - **Deliver tailored solutions** specific to your needs.
> - **Offer consultation** whenever you have any questions.
> - Recommend improvements that **won’t disrupt your business**.
> - Provide expert help for **a fraction of what a salaried IT person would cost**.

*Remote consultation isn’t the same as having full-time IT staff. We’re here to guide you and make sure your setup is solid and stress-free, and we look forward to seeing what we can do for you.*
