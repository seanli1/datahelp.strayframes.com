# Stray Frames Does Data

We provide expert consultation for **individuals and teams who feel stranded** when it comes to managing their data and digital workflows.

Think of us as your **tech handyman**: not a salaried IT person on staff, but a trusted problem-solver, who understands both technology and video production, and can design a setup that works for the way you operate.

## Our process

We listen to your needs, create a tailored blueprint to help optimize your workflow, and then guide you through implementing it.

After setup, we offer basic maintenance for a recurring fee to keep things running smoothly (drive health and file integrity checks, NAS monitoring), and email consultation for follow-up questions or custom adjustments.

We work remotely, and by design, are not your on-site IT department, but we aim to make sure your setup is reliable, low-maintenance, and built to last.
