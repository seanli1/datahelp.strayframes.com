### Pre-onboarding (customers have decided the path, things that they are required to DO)

- set up ethernet - get long enough cables, be able to reach the router, make sure there's an available port (if not then buy a switch)
- **Make pre-onboarding questionnaire:** questionnaire asking more specific questions about their current setup - custom routing setup, VLAN, static IPs/IP reservations, servers, networking tunnels, ISP and internet plan,
