# What is a 3-2-1 backup strategy?

The 3-2-1 backup strategy is the golden rule for keeping your data safe.

It's simple: keep **3 copies of your data**, stored on **2 different types of storage media**, with **1 copy offsite**, at a different location from the others. (Over time, with HDDs being so reliable and cloud storage being so accessible, this has somewhat evolved to also mean, "3 copies: 2 local and 1 offsite/cloud".)

That way, if your main device dies, your external drive fails, or a disaster strikes your home or office, you’ve still got at least one safe copy of your important files somewhere. It's a simple and time-tested method of protecting data.

3-2-1 isn’t overkill, and it's actually the *bare minimum* for real data protection. Yet too people rely on a single hard drive or basic cloud storage and think they’re covered, not realizing they're taking on the risk of drive failure or account lockout. Buying extra drives hurts, but losing data hurts more.

The 3-2-1 backup system is the standard for a reason, and if you don't already have it in place, [[1. Get Started/1.1 Intro\|now's a great time to address it]].
