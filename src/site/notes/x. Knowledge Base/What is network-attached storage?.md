# What is network-attached storage?

A NAS (Network Attached Storage) is a dedicated device on your home or office network that stores your files in one central place, accessible from any connected device. It usually consists of a small computer server with multiple hard drives, and provides built-in redundancy and sharing features.

Many people use NAS systems for dependable backups, collaborative file access, and long-term storage without relying on third-party cloud services.
