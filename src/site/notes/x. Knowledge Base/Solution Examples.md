## We can...

- “set up NAS so you own your own data”
- “consultation regarding basic cyber hygiene”
- “they can choose to back up with deduplicated version history”
- “periodic integrity checks (scrubbing, checksums)”
- “ransomware-resistant backups (append-only)”
- “clear documentation to restore data in case of loss or accidental deletion”
- “consultation regarding best methods for secure file sharing”
- "protection against power loss" (remember to also put your modem and router on the UPS)
- “set up shared network drives with access over the internet”
- - **Multi-location Sync Setup** – Configure secure, encrypted sync between multiple offices or devices (ownCloud, Syncthing, etc.) to keep remote teams in sync without third-party cloud reliance.
- **Versioned Snapshot Rollbacks** – Automate local or NAS-based snapshots for fast recovery from user mistakes or ransomware, beyond just deduplicated history.
- **Encrypted Offsite Backup Rotation** – Set up encrypted backups to a secondary location (friend's NAS, remote VPS, or offline drives) for disaster recovery.
- **Self-hosted Password Management** – Install and configure self-hosted password vaults (e.g., Bitwarden or Vaultwarden) for better password hygiene without third-party storage.
- **Secure Remote Access Gateways** – Configure VPN or Tailscale for accessing NAS or shared drives securely over public networks.
- **Integrity Monitoring and Alerts** – Build scripts or use built-in NAS tools to send alerts when files are modified, deleted, or fail checksum verification.
- **Automated Drive Health Monitoring** – Configure SMART tests and proactive notifications for drive health to prevent data loss before failure.
- **User Access Management** – Set up tiered permissions and separate credentials for shared drives (e.g., family members, employees, clients) to reduce accidental deletions or data leaks.
- **Encrypted File Transfer Setup** – Implement SFTP or client-to-client encrypted links for sending sensitive files securely.
- **Local “Cloud” Replacement** – Configure web-accessible interfaces (Nextcloud) with calendaring, contacts, and file storage to replace Google Drive/Dropbox.
- **Offline Recovery Kits** – Prepare pre-configured USB sticks or rescue media for restoring data if the NAS becomes unbootable or corrupted.
- **Immutable Backup Chains** – Add backup hardening via WORM (Write Once, Read Many) policies or air-gapped backups for extra ransomware protection.
- **UPS Event Automation** – Automate safe shutdown scripts for NAS and critical devices during prolonged power outages.
- **Network Segmentation for Security** – Configure VLANs or isolated networks to keep storage devices protected from potentially infected PCs or IoT devices.
- **Data Archival Strategy** – Advise and set up cold storage (long-term, low-cost, rarely accessed) solutions for old projects or personal data.
- **File Deduplication & Compression Optimization** – Implement intelligent dedupe and compression for clients dealing with large datasets (e.g., video, photography).
- **Automated “Backup Audit” Reports** – Monthly reports showing backup success, integrity checks, and restore test results for client peace of mind.
- **Client Education Sessions** – Small workshops or one-on-one training on recognizing phishing, safe file sharing, and secure digital habits.
- **LAN Speed Optimization** – Improve wired/wireless networks for faster file transfer and reduce bottlenecks when accessing NAS over local or remote connections.
- **Data Lifecycle Management Policies** – Set up automated deletion or archival schedules to keep storage organized and reduce risk of keeping unnecessary sensitive data.
- And more!
