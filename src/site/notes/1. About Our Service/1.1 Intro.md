# Stray Frames Does Data

## What we do

We provide expert consultation for **individuals and teams who feel stranded** when it comes to managing their data and digital workflows.

Think of us as **your best friend who also works in IT**: not a salaried IT person on staff, but a trusted problem-solver who is invested in your goals and [understands both technology and video production](https://www.strayframes.com/dmcs), delivering tailored setups that fit the way you work.

## Our process

We listen to your needs, create a tailored blueprint to help optimize your workflow, and then guide you through implementing it.

After setup, we offer basic maintenance to keep things running smoothly, and email consultation for follow-up questions and further guidance to meet your unique needs.

## We provide consultation, first and foremost

We work remotely, and so by design, cannot be your on-site IT department. We aim to make sure your setup is reliable, low-maintenance, and built to last. **However, at the end of the day, your data is your data.**

> [!fail] What we don’t do
> **We can’t promise to be on-site or on-call 24/7/365 for emergencies.** Remote support has its limitations, and while we’ll do everything we can to prepare you in case of emergency, we cannot commit to immediate responses at all hours.

> [!done] What we do
> - **Assess your overall workflow** and highlight where it can be improved for security or efficiency.
> - **Provide support via email**, as well as scheduled screen sharing and phone/video calls.
> - **Deliver tailored solutions** specific to your needs.
> - **Offer consultation** whenever you have any questions.
> - Recommend improvements that **won’t disrupt your business**.
> - Provide expert remote guidance for **a fraction of what a salaried IT person would cost**.
