# What We Offer

We provide two tiers of service: **Starter** and **Pro**.

And our service is delivered in two phases: one-time **Setup** and ongoing **Maintenance**.

---
# Phase 1: Setup

## *Starter* Tier

> [!info] About the *Starter* tier
> Give your business a **robust data storage scheme with basic remote access**.
> 
> This is the basic setup that everyone deserves.

- **Network-attached storage (NAS) setup** - We configure a private NAS so you fully own your data, keeping it accessible without relying on third-party cloud providers.
- **Resilient [[x. Knowledge Base/What is a 3-2-1 backup strategy?\|3-2-1 Backup System]]** - Build a backup workflow that is resilient, yet effortless, and which allow for version history (allowing you to roll back files to earlier versions).
- **Power loss protection** - Install UPS systems and safe shutdown automation to keep your NAS, router, and modem from corrupting data during outages.
- **Shared network drive access** - Create secure, organized shared drives for your home or office that are easy to access locally or over the internet.
## *Pro* Tier

> [!tip] About the *Pro* tier
> Elevate your setup with **tailored and customizable data and networking solutions**, built to your specifications.
> 
> See how your workflow can adapt to your needs, and not the other way around.

### This includes everything in the *Starter* tier, plus:

- **Tailored workflow solutions** - Design systems built around your unique workflow instead of one-size-fits-all public tools.
- **User access management** - Assign permissions and individual accounts to reduce the risk of accidental deletions or unauthorized access to shared storage.
- **Automated syncing between computers** - Enable encrypted, automatic syncing between multiple devices or offices to keep remote teams on the same page without public cloud reliance.
- **Remote access for other network devices** - Set up secure remote access for printers, cameras, media servers, and other networked equipment.
- **Custom domain, email, and hosting setup** - Configure your own domain name, branded email addresses, and hosting environment.
- **Connect domain with preferred email provider** - Set up email backed by an email provider you prefer (ProtonMail, Gmail, etc.).
- **Domain connections for existing services** - Link your custom domain to compatible services you already use, improving branding for portals or client-facing tools.
- **Network Topology Consultation** - Advise on optimal network layout and device connections for reliability and performance.

# Phase 2: Maintenance

After your system is up and running, we provide the following to make sure things keep running smoothly:

- **Drive health monitoring** - Set up early warning systems for drive degradation to avoid unexpected data loss from failing hardware.
- **Automated integrity checks** - Regular scrubbing and checksum verification to ensure your backups stay healthy and uncorrupted over time.
- **Email support and continued check-ins** regarding your setup or about data management and cybersecurity in general.
- **Maintenance of custom solutions (Pro tier only)** - Customized solutions are supported remotely to maintain best possible continued functionality.
