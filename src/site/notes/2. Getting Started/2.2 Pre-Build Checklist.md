# Pre-Build Checklist

> [!summary] Before we begin
> Because our work is done remotely, there are a few simple preparations we can’t do on your behalf.
> 
> Taking care of these steps ahead of time helps ensure everything is ready on your end, making the consultation smoother, faster, and more effective once we get on the call.

- [ ] **Prepare a Wired Ethernet Connection:** Use a cable long enough to reach your router (if no free port is available, you’ll need a small network switch).
- [ ] **Designate a Technical Point of Contact:** Identify someone on-site who is comfortable following instructions, installing software, and performing basic troubleshooting during setup.
- [ ] **Verify Access Credentials:** Have administrator usernames and passwords ready for devices or services we’ll configure (router, NAS, cloud accounts, etc.).
- [ ] **Check Power and Space Requirements:** Make sure the equipment we’ll work on has stable power, enough ventilation, and a permanent spot where it won’t be unplugged or moved accidentally.
- [ ] **Update Devices:** Apply any pending software or firmware updates to relevant devices ahead of time to reduce delays and security risks.
- [ ] **Organize Current Setup Notes:** If you already have backups, folder structures, or a storage workflow, prepare a brief outline or screenshots to help us understand your environment quickly.
