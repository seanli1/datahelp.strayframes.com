# Onboarding
## Before You Sign Up

Before committing to one of our strategies, please read the following carefully. These points are **mandatory** for your security and system stability. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in serious vulnerabilities, data loss, or service disruption. **We cannot guarantee safety, functionality, or continued support if these instructions are ignored.*

- **Ethernet is required.** Wireless-only connections are not supported and will not be guaranteed reliable or secure.
- **You must have a technically capable person on-site.** They need to be able to install software, navigate system settings, and follow detailed instructions during remote sessions. Without this, successful implementation and support cannot be guaranteed.
- **Root account security is critical.** Your `root` user passphrase must be 15–25 characters, complex, and unique. Weak or reused passwords invalidate any guarantee of system safety.
- **Never enable port forwarding on your router.** You should not need it for any setup we design, and doing so exposes your network to unnecessary risks. Any configuration using port forwarding is unsupported.
- **Tailscale grants full access to your computer.** It should only ever be used between trusted devices. If you must receive files from untrusted users, you are responsible for restricting their access or using a safer transfer method (such as a public HTTPS endpoint with a REST server or a secure file transfer service with encryption).
- **Tailscale access must remain trusted only.** Never add unknown people or anyone you do not fully trust to your Tailnet. If you need to grant temporary access, add the user and revoke or disable their access immediately afterward. We cannot be responsible for unauthorized access caused by client-approved users.
- **Unraid-specific warnings:**
	- On Unraid, _every_ user on your Tailnet has unrestricted power over the server, including the ability to shut it down or alter data remotely. You accept this risk if you choose to grant others access.
	- For safer setups, we recommend routing access through a more secure intermediary device. Choosing not to implement this layer is at your own risk.

## Pre-Build Checklist

- [ ] **Prepare a Wired Ethernet Connection:** Use a cable long enough to reach your router (if no free port is available, you’ll need a small network switch).
- [ ] **Designate a Technical Point of Contact:** Identify someone on-site who is comfortable following instructions, installing software, and performing basic troubleshooting during setup.
- [ ] **Verify Access Credentials:** Have administrator usernames and passwords ready for devices or services we’ll configure (router, NAS, cloud accounts, etc.).
- [ ] **Check Power and Space Requirements:** Make sure the equipment we’ll work on has stable power, enough ventilation, and a permanent spot where it won’t be unplugged or moved accidentally.
- [ ] **Update Devices:** Apply any pending software or firmware updates to relevant devices ahead of time to reduce delays and security risks.
- [ ] **Organize Current Setup Notes:** If you already have backups, folder structures, or a storage workflow, prepare a brief outline or screenshots to help us understand your environment quickly.
